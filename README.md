## Project Scope
The purpose of this project was to model airflow through a rotor in an airduct. Under given conditions, we were to plot various properties of the air at multiple positions along the axial direction of the duct. We were to model the airflow using the REE equation, obtaining the results for the compressible and incompressible cases.
